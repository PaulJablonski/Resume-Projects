# Projects
Projects that are a part of my independent studies accompanied by my resume.

**Currently Includes:**
1. ***Android Embedded Security System*** - Manual object-detecting Android application meant for security applications, detects, isolates, and labels people in camera feed utilizing manual DB-scanning, k-means color processing, and image calibration techniques.
2. ***FPGA Granular Synthesizer*** - WIP project that aims to transform any vocal input into an FPGA audio codec into a granularly synthesized output, for playback adjustment, musical instrumentation, etc.
3. ***FPGA Soccer Heads*** - A recreation of a classic flash game that incorporated SystemVerilog and C onto a Microblaze FPGA board that was connected to peripheral devices such as a monitor and keyboard.
4. ***Handwritten Text Recognition*** - Classifies single hand-illustrated character from user's input using SVM and convolution, where both the back-end and front-end were created from scratch using Python3 (Full Stack).
5. ***Illini Harmonics*** - A GCP-hosted music-based social web app made with SQL, React, and Python for rating your listening history and sharing it with friends.
6. ***Laser & Voice Assisted Cat Toy*** - Autonomous cat toy capable of collision avoidance, treat dispensing, catch detection, and audio-based commands. Involved PCB development, custom CAD modelling for the shell, and Arduino programming for the toy's behavioral state machine.
