# Projects
Projects that are a part of my independent studies accompanied by my resume.

**Currently Includes:**
1. ***FPGA Soccer Heads*** - A recreation of a classic flash game that incorporated SystemVerilog and C onto a Microblaze FPGA board that was connected to peripheral devices such as a monitor and keyboard.
2. ***Illini Harmonics*** - A GCP-hosted music-based social web app made with SQL, React, and Python for rating your listening history and sharing it with friends.
3. ***Handwritten Text Recognition*** - Classifies single hand-illustrated character from user's input using SVM and convolution, where both the back-end and front-end were created from scratch using Python3 (Full Stack).
