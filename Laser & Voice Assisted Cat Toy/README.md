# Laser & Voice Assisted Cat Toy

**Description:**

This project involves a mouse-like toy, which has been seen before, but is now refined with multiple more advanced systems. The primary sensors consist of a distance measuring laser, a vibrational sensor, and a microphone in tandem with a miniature speaker. The first two serve in engaging the cat and improving both longevity and noise generation, whereas the final sensor system vastly improves user interaction through various voice commands. More specifically, the laser can be utilized to avoid collisions and detect ahead of the mouse, sparking movement changes that are more realistic for an animal. The vibrational sensor furthermore detects when the toy has been caught, which either dispenses a treat or plays dead depending on the toy's state. Finally, the aforementioned voice commands allow for the user to locate the toy at any time, or manually activate the toy itself without a need for physical contact.

Physically speaking, the non-rolling shape of a mouse also allows for more rigid and controllable movement. This is important for stabilizing the toyâ€™s primary sensors and allows for greater reactivity to its environment and consequently less noisy behavior. The sensors as mentioned also are accompanied by several motorized and more physical systems. A moving tail is used to mimic the more excitatory behaviors of prey, making it more engaging than a typical toy's static tail. This is accompanied by faster motorized movements and more realistic movement states as is regulated by a microcontroller and stepper motor-driven wheel system. Further speaking, a latch can be controlled through a servo and used for dispensing treats from the back of the toy upon being caught. And finally, a rechargeable lithium ion battery is incorporated and regulated by a circuit protection system for easy re-usability.
 
The toy itself comprises four total subsystems:
