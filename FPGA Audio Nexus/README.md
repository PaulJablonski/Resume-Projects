**This project is a work-in-progress:**

This project aims to develop a DE-10 Standard FPGA device that transforms any standard aux-connected pair of headphones into noise-cancelling ones using digital signal processing. The device will include a microphone to capture ambient noise, receive input audio from a desktop device, process it via FPGA-driven algorithms, and will then output the processed audio to the headphones.

The DE-10 FPGA board chosen contains two USB inputs, alongside a mic-in, line-in, and line-out set of connectors - making this all possible. Drivers will be developed to accommodate these. Extensions include other audio processing enhancements such as creating a pass-through effect, or making the device compatible with more output formats such as USB, given the additional port.
