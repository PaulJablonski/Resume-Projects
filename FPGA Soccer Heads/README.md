# FPGA Soccer Heads

**Description:**

This project recreated the classic flash game of Soccer Heads using SystemVerilog and C onto a Microblaze FGPA board. This game involves two player modules, one controlled by the user and one by an AI program. 
The two player modules play off in a three minute round of 2D soccer, which ends when the real-time timer is over or when one player scored nine goals. Recreating this game required implementing: 

* SPI protocols for connecting peripheral devices.
* A physics system for gravity and acceleration.
* Menus with a finite state machine.
* Collision detection with the ball and goals.
* Sophisticated sprite drawing.
* AI capable of player-like movement.
